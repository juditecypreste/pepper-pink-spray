# Lede Project 1: Pepper Pink Spray

This repository include the data and notebooks used for the second project I've worked on as a part of the Lede program for Data Journalism from Columbia Graduate School of Journalism.

# The project
## Pepper Pink Spray
Butterflies, flowers, and hearts. These adornments found in old teen magazines can also be easily identified on pepper spray packaging. In this report, we will investigate why pepper sprays have gender.

# The files:
1. [Getting the data][(https://github.com/juditecypreste/pepper-pink-spray/blob/main/pepper_spray_analysis.ipynb)](https://github.com/juditecypreste/pepper-pink-spray/blob/main/scrapper_mercado_livre.ipynb)

In this file, I demonstrate how I was able to scrape all the data from Pepper Spray advertisements on the Mercado Livre e-commerce platform using the Beautiful Soup library. Mercado Livre is the largest online marketplace in Brazil.

2. [The data](https://github.com/juditecypreste/pepper-pink-spray/blob/main/data_spray.csv)

This is the result of my scraper.

3. [Analyzing the data](https://github.com/juditecypreste/pepper-pink-spray/blob/main/pepper_spray_analysis.ipynb)

In this notebook, I cleaned and analyzed the data using the pandas library.


# New tools and skills

My focus in this report was to explore new ways of creating graphics. For this purpose, I used Illustrator to design the shapes based on the charts generated by Flourish. I also had the opportunity to dive deeper into the Beautiful Soup library, which I had always found a bit challenging to understand.

# I could not

Working with illustrations was extremely tedious and complicated. In the end, I wasn't able to animate everything I wanted, and I believe that in the future, this report could benefit from a new layout style. Additionally, dealing with Ai2html was difficult, and there are still many aspects of this tool that I don't fully understand.
